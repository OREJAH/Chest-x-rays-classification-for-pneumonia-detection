## * Review of the Project

In this project, a binary classification model will be built using chest x-ray images. This classification system is targeted at children, adults over the age of 65 and other individuals with underlying respiratory illness. There is a scarce availability of healthcare practitioners and radiologists around the globe whose prediction on pneumonia cases matter greatly. Therefore, the deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) would give an higher accuracy in the prediction of pneumonia and it will further stand as a prelude to serve as a better model for other life-threatening illnesses.

## * Project Environment Set Up
The models that will be utilized in this project are large and may take a long time to execute on a standard CPU.
